# Slake

## A simple build system based on [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine), inspired by [llbuild2](https://github.com/apple/swift-llbuild2) and [rock](https://github.com/ollef/rock)

Slake is a prototype of a [query-based](https://ollef.github.io/blog/posts/query-based-compilers.html) build system.
It is still at a very early stage, and there isn't much usable code at the moment.
